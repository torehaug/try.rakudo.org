    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to try.rakudo.org and its
    supporting works.  It is sorted by name and formatted to
    allow easy grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), git username (U) and snail-mail
    address (S). Please try to keep them sorted alphabetically
    by first name.

        Thanks,

        try.rakudo.org Developers
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
        PPS: This file is encoded in UTF-8
