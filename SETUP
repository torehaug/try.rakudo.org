# Backend:

First of all, go to the `backend` directory and try running:

    perl persist.pl

If the program just sits there doing apparently nothing (and listening on port
11211), then it's working. If it spits out an error then you probably need a
backend.conf file to tell it where your perl6 binary and p6safe.pl are. This
should be a single line of the form:

   /path/to/perl6 /path/to/p6safe.pl

All the other code in the backend uses relative file paths, so you'll likely
want to start the backend from inside there in order for anything to work.

If the backend refuses to start and complains it's already running when it
clearly isn't, delete the `persist.pid` file.

# Frontend:

The web server can be run standalone by going to the `frontend` directory and
running:

   perl try-rakudo.pl daemon

This will run a basic web server on localhost:3000. For more details on
configuring the web server please refer to the Mojolicious documentation.
There's an example Apache config file in the `doc` directory.
